RS-GNN v3.3 — Transition-Aware + Lifecycle-Filtered Gradient (LFG).

CANONICAL MODEL = DETACHED READOUT  (enable_main_predictor=False, the default).
  The link-prediction logit is produced by the lifecycle / existence-decoder
  readout operating on DETACHED backbone features. The backbone (CSN/ECTG/DRGC)
  is shaped by the continuous laws + the VAE-KL / TIP parsimony term
  (lambda_echo·KL), NOT by the link-prediction BCE. Empirically this decoupled
  head generalizes BETTER inductively than routing BCE into the backbone — the
  3-dataset / 3-seed A/B confirmed the detached arm wins every
  dataset (wiki +0.59%, mooc +0.26%, coedit +9.4% Ind-AP). The "detach" is an
  intentional design choice, not a bug.

Pipeline (canonical, detached):
  Backbone (v3.1 lean continuous laws) → h_uv   [shaped by KL/TIP, not by BCE]
       ↓ (features read with stop-grad by the readout stream)
  ┌─── (stop-grad) ────────────────────────────┐
  │ State Observer → s_t                        │
  │ Transition Predictor + FSM Mask → s_{t+1}  │
  │ Existence Decoder → P(edge | symbolic)      │  ← link-prediction logit
  │ LFG Compliance Score → c                    │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
       ↓
  L = c · BCE(existence_logit, label)       (readout on detached features)
      + λ_echo · KL  + λ_mask · L_violation

PREDICTION-HEAD ABLATION = END-TO-END  (enable_main_predictor=True).
  Toggled via the benchmark runner's --p0_fix {on,off,both}. This adds a
  NON-detached Main Edge Predictor on the post-DRGC embeddings and routes the
  link-prediction BCE (+LFG) through it, so the backbone IS trained end-to-end
  by link prediction. This is our primary comparison prediction-head ablation (decoupled
  readout vs end-to-end backbone training); empirically it HURTS inductive AP
  (it was the original "P0 fix"). Kept fully runnable for the ablation table.

Key properties:
  1. FSM symbolic stream is fully decoupled (stop-grad) — interpretation +,
     in the canonical arm, the prediction readout.
  2. The end-to-end Main Edge Predictor (ablation arm only) carries the
     link-prediction signal into DRGC/ECTG/CSN.
  3. Gradient gating (LFG) filters rule-violating events.

                 MULTIPLIES the per-event loss → it can ONLY mask/attenuate the
                 link-prediction gradient of causally-incoherent events; it never
                 contributes its own gradient and never changes the prediction VALUE.
                 Negatives are always weight 1 (not gated). This is meaningful only

        "canonical" → no preset; each individual flag takes its own default → the
                      no-arg model reproduces the canonical detached run byte-for-byte.
