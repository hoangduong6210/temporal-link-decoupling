"""
FSM Head for RS-GNN v3.3.

Components:
  - StateObserver: reads h.detach() → soft state distribution s_t
  - TransitionPredictor: (h, s_t) → 5x5 transition logits
  - LifecycleFSMMask: soft mask with ever_alive accumulator
  - ExistenceDecoder: P(s_{t+1}) → P(edge exists)

Key design: ALL FSM components use h.detach() — never propagate gradient to backbone.

# each state reaches {previous, self, next}, single-rung moves only. The prior C was
# a different (non-adjacent) rule set (e.g. it allowed BIRTH→IDLE / DEATH→BIRTH but
# forbade BIRTH→BIRTH... actually allowed self), which meant the LFG gate flagged a
# DIFFERENT set of transitions as violations than the mask used for prediction — an
# inconsistency. Encoded rules (single-rung, no 2-step jumps):
#   - IDLE (no prev): only stay IDLE or be BORN; cannot skip to REINFORCE/DECAY/DEATH.
#   - BIRTH: {IDLE (dormancy), BIRTH, REINFORCE}; not DECAY/DEATH (no 2-step).
#   - REINFORCE: {BIRTH (regress), REINFORCE, DECAY}; not IDLE/DEATH directly.
#   - DECAY: {REINFORCE (recovery), DECAY, DEATH}; not IDLE/BIRTH directly.
#   - DEATH: {DECAY (single-rung revival path), DEATH}; revival now flows back through
#     DECAY→REINFORCE→… one rung at a time (matches the bi-directional FSM), not a
#     direct DEATH→BIRTH jump.
